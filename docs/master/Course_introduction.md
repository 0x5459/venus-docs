# venus master classes

Introducing the ["Venus Master Fellowship"]() program for teams or individuals who have demonstrated their technical-know-how in setuping a storage providing oeration with Venus. If you wish to become a **Venus Master**, please make sure that you go through the following classes which we have prepared so that you may help others to bootstrap their storage providing operations.

Responsibilities for being a venus master includes but not limited to: 
- Help participants establish connection to chain services
- Answer the technical questions from the community
- Help daily maintain maintenance and operation of chain services

To better serve incubation participants as a ***venus master***, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of the venus chain service and access process. To this end, we have prepared master classes so that the venus master can get started quickly and learn systematically.
