# venus master course

In order to ensure participants' seamless access to the second phase of the incubation center,
We are looking for 3 to 5 people who are active in the venus community, have demonstrated their technical-know-how and are interested in being ***venus master*** as their contribution to the community.
Responsibilities for being a venus master includes but not limited to: 
- Help participants establish connection to chain services
- Answer the technical questions from the community
- Help daily maintain maintenance and operation of chain services

To better serve incubation participants as a ***venus master***, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of the venus chain service and access process. To this end, we have prepared master classes so that the venus master can get started quickly and learn systematically.
