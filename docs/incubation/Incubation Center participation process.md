</br>

### 1. Application

#### 1.1 Submit application

[Rules & Requirements](https://venus.filecoin.io/incubation/Rules.html)

[Incubation Center Prize Pool](https://venus.filecoin.io/incubation/Incubation_Center_Prize_Pool.html)

[Application Form](http://venusteam.mikecrm.com/1lmpQtj)


#### 1.2 Get in touch

The Venus team will check the application form and reach out to applicants.

Applicants will be contacted through e-mail (email sender: *venus@ipfsforce.com*). Please make sure that the e-mail is filled in correctly in application form. We found that some applicants have filled in the e-mail format incorrectly.

In addition, we strongly recommend using [Slack](https://app.slack.com) to get in touch with the Venus team. The [Filecoin slack](filecoinproject.slack.com) workspace can provide more efficient technical consultancy and support.

### 2. Preparations

#### 2.1 Preparation of hardware and collateral. 

The specific HW configuration and quantity are determined by the participants' situation. 

You may refer to community suggestions, the Filecoin Slack Venus channel provides some key links, but please be minded, these links for reference only.

#### 2.2 Be familiar with the deployment process in calibration network

Participants obtain tokens and URLs of the chain service (venus shared modules) provided by the incubation center on the Calibration network through the Venus team.

Participants use previously prepared hardware to deploy independent components **venus-sealer** and **venus-wallet** to connect to the chain services provided above to start storage providing. 

[Documentation](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/Using-venus-Shared-Modules.html)

#### 2.3 Optional: If participants need to use existing Lotus nodes to join the incubation center
    
Get prepared for these questions below, based on different actual situations, venus team will provide consultancy
    
 - What version of Lotus was previously used?
 - Have you accepted deals?
 - Do I need to continue to accept deals?

</br>

### 3. Join Filecoin Network

#### 3.1 Join mainnet

Refer to the above Calibration network deployment process. [Set up different networks](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/How-To-Connect-Network.html).

Participants obtain tokens and URLs of the chain service (venus shared modules) provided by the incubation center on mainnet supported by Venus team.

Participants use hardware previously prepared to deploy independent modules **venus-sealer** and **venus-wallet** to connect to the chain services to start storage providing.

</br>

### 4. Growing storage power 

#### 4.1 Sealing sectors and maintaining power

Participants are required to seal more than 32 sectors (1TiB) per day. For hardware optimization, please refer to the [info](https://venus.filecoin.io/operation/Efficiency_of_sealing.html) below for reference only:

You need to submit WindowPoSt stably during this operation. Please make sure to take notes on your proving window for your WindowPoSt submission. Contact the Venus team or the community if you encounter any abnormalities during the process.

 - We are opposed to the fact that participants are unable to establish effective communication and effective feedback with the Venus team or the community, resulting in poor stability of their nodes and causing a large amount of invalid workload for both parties.

</br>

### 5. Exit Process Guide

Before the end of each incubation center phase, choose different exit plans and make preparations in advance.
There are two main exit schemes, which can be chosen on actual situation of the participants.

#### 5.1.1 Participants deploy their own or jointly deploy chain services with other storage providers
Based on experience gained during incubation, participants can deploy chain services (venus shared components) by themselves to provide services for themselves. Venus team and community are here to support and provide necessary technical assistance.

#### 5.1.2 Switch to Lotus
Participants can switch the node to Lotus to continue running. We plan to publish related [documents](https://venus.filecoin.io) to provide detailed reference. Venus team and community are here to support and provide necessary technical assistance.

#### 5.1.2 TBD
