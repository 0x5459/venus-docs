### Looking for a introduction to the Filecoin network?

Filecoin currently offers several node implementations including a `Lotus` implementation (also in GoLang) that is currently the recommended default. For a more general introduction to the Filecoin network and underlying concepts that apply across all implementations, please visit the [Filecoin Docs](https://docs.filecoin.io) and [Filecoin Specification](https://spec.filecoin.io).
